**What make someone charismatic?** ::
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li>*Lacking Agenda* They aren't fake nice. Guys are nice to girls because they want sex/relationship in return. Employees are nice to bosses because they want a promotion. Truly likable are nice to people without wanting anything in return i.e. *being nice only when they feel like it.*</li>
<li>*Noble Intentions* Even if they lack social charm, they don't have wrong intentions of manipulation. Anyone can practice a few charisma tricks and make themselves likable but without good intentions, it won't last</li>
<li>*Having Honor* They take the right action even if it means sacrificing their ego or pleasure. i.e. *accepting one's mistake despite a blow on ego.*</li>
<li>*Showing Humility* Being humble despite their achievements. They are open to learning from others. Mark Zuckerberg, Einstein, despite their talents, had mentors.</li>
<li>*Lacking Desperation* They have a life. They know their priorities. Self-improvement and work are more important to them than begging for strangers' times and approval.</li>
<li>*Not Judging* They don't constantly judge what others are doing. Have you met an old person who was rude and bitter? We all have a part of this person in ourselves. They fix that bitterness instead of cultivating.</li>
<li>*Facing Adversity* They face challenges without getting bitter.</li>
</ul>
