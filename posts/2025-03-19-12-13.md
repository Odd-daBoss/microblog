**Let Your Stomach Talk!** :: 
Instead of trying to bring out the sounds from your throat, bring your voice from the pit of stomach. To practice this try reaching the end of the room with your voice *without raising your volume*.

You can also check your chest and throat while you talk. If just your throat vibrates you are not talking your voice from deep within.
